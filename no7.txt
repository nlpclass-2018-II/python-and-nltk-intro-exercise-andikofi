-Token Lemmatization. What is the difference between token lemmatization and token stemming? Could you perform stemming
 by using NLTK?

Stemming algorithms work by cutting off the end of the word, and in some cases also the beginning while looking for the 
root.

Lemmatization on the other hand takes into consideration the morphological analysis of the words.

The main difference is that a lemma is the base form of all its inflectional forms. However, the stem can be the same 
for the inflectional forms of different lemmas, providing then noise to our search results.  

yes we can perform stemming using nltk


-Sentence tokenization, but try to use a sentence in Bahasa Indonesia. Do you notice any difference? Do you think the 
tokenization function could run successfully on any language? yes
